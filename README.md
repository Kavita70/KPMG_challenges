KPMG technical challenges....

## Challenge 1
-- A 3 tier environment is a common setup. Use a tool of your choosing/familiarity create these resources. Please remember we will not be judged on the outcome but more focusing on the approach, style and reproducibility.

- File with solution is challenge_1.pptx
- I have done a detailed solution for challenge 1 as I have keen interest and experience in DevOps/AWS technology process and implementation. I have hosted a web application with a 3 -tier architecture in AWS cloud and the basic AWS services used to get an highly available, scalable and secured environment.


## Challenge 2
-- to write code that will query the meta data of an instance within aws and provide a json formatted output. The choice of language and implementation is up to you.
 
Bonus Points
The code allows for a particular data key to be retrieved individually
- File with solution is  challenge_2_3.txt
- I understand the logic behind to retrieve the metadata of the instance but do not have much experience in coding so have just explained the logic using Python as scritping language.  
- I will be open and keen to learn and develop on any coding language as I understand the basic logic behind it. 


## Challenge 3
-- We have a nested object, we would like a function that you pass in the object and a key and get back the value. How this is implemented is up to you.
- File with  solution is challenge_2_3.txt
- Again for this challenge I have explained the logic that would be  applied for coding.
